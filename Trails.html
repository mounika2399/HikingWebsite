					<p class="p1">Foot trails are the typical trails that probably come to mind when you think of hiking. Slip on your hiking shoes and go! Distance, incline, terrain and 
					   difficulty can vary. Some foot trails are rugged dirt paths that lead you up mountain tops, some foot trails are flat, paved sidewalks that meander through 
					   cities and urban areas. Consult a park map or chat with a ranger at the visitor center to pick a path that’s right for you.

					<h2 class="h2"><a name="b"><em>Bikeways</em></h2>
					<img class="img2" src="images/bikeways.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="bikeways">
					<p class="p2">Like the name suggests, bikeways, or bike paths, are trails that allow bicyclists. Some trails may be multi-use (allowing bikes, hikers, and horses to 
			     	   use the same trail) before giving way to bike or foot-only specific paths. Be sure to consult a trail map before starting your journey so you know what to 
					   expect. And always, practice good hiking etiquette and know your right-of-way.

				<section id="Boardwalks">
					<h2 class="h3"><a name="c"><em>Boardwalks</em></h2>
					<img class="img3" src="images/boardwalks.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="boardwalks">
					<p class="p3">Boardwalks are walkways that cross over water or marshy ground. They’re typically made of wood or other smooth materials, and are accessible to 
					   wheelchairs. Please check with your park to see if there are accessible trails available. You’ll often find boardwalks close to parking lots, 
					   so expect larger crowds.
					</p>
			<div>
				<section id="multiuse">
					<h2 class="h4"><a name="d"><em>Multi-use Trails</em></h2>
					<img class="img4"src="images/multiuse.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="multiuse trails">
					<p class="p4">Hikers, bicyclists, and horses share the dirt on multi-use trails. Know your right of way! Be mindful of trail etiquette on multi-use trails. 
					   Bikes and horses can use some trails and roads in parks, but be sure to check for signs. Check with your park to find designated bike trails.
