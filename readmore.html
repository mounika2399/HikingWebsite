						<p>National parks offer a wide range of hiking trails to accommodate different hiking skills and capabilities. You won’t miss out on the spectacular views, 
						   wildlife sightings, and connection with nature by choosing an easier trail for your adventure. Don’t overestimate your abilities. Take the time 
						   to ask yourself before you go:
						</p>
						<p><b>What is my experience level with hiking?</b> Do I go hiking often or is this my first time hitting the trails?</br><br><b>How much equipment, food, and water 
						   (weight) can I comfortably carry in a backpack?</b> How long can I carry a backpack with all the essentials?</br><br><b>Have I ever hiked in this type of 
						   environment before?</b> Environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity take time to get used to, especially if you live in a different 
						   environment from the park you are visiting.
						</p>
					
						<h1><a name="b"><em>Plan Your Hike</em></h1>
						<center><img class="img3" src="images/plan.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="plan"></center>
						<p>Your safety is your responsibility while hiking in national parks. Planning is an important step in being prepared and ready for your adventure. 
						   If you are going to the backcountry, know how to be self sufficient in case you encounter an unexpected hazard or an emergency occurs.
						</p>
						<p><b>Have a way to communicate.</b> Do not rely on your cell phone because there may not be cellular coverage and reception in your park. Consider having a 
							  personal locator beacon, should you need to call for help. If you are using your cell phone, keep the battery fully charged. Searching for a cell signal
							  can quickly drain your phone battery, so consider turning off your phone or switching to airplane mode until you need it.
						</p>
						<p><b>Be weather-ready.</b> Check the weather before you head out on your hike. If conditions in the park are not ideal, don’t take the chance! Be prepared to 
							seek shelter if you encounter severe weather, know what to do in case of lightning or flash flooding. Have your rain equipment packed and ready.
						</p>
						<p><b>Have an Emergency Plan.</b> Develop an emergency plan for what to do if you or your hiking companions becomes lost or injured. Consider learning CPR and basic 
							wilderness first aid, especially if your planning to hike in the backcountry.
